# keras-mnist-example
An example with details and various architectures to classify the MNIST data set using keras

The code is in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/gardenermike/keras-mnist-example/blob/master/Example.ipynb)

You can run each cell in turn, although the model architectures make sense to run separately.
